# **OBJECTIVE :**
1. To enhance the accuracy of a previously implemented priority mail recommendation system.
2. To improve the system's user-friendliness.
3. Implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for context analysis and queries.

## **DOMAIN:** 
Deep Learning

## **SUB-DOMAIN:** 
Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## **INTRODUCTION:**
In today's modern organizations, employees face challenges in managing work-related documents across various systems and adapting to flexible team structures. This project aims to address these challenges using deep learning and NLP. By suggesting email priorities based on context and past interactions, we aim to reduce information overload and enhance time management for employees. Additionally, an automated response feature will handle common queries efficiently.
